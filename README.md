These two .R files contain the source functions and the example to calculate the SVI either at cbg or zcta level in each state of the US. To see how this works, run examples.R. To see the function used in examples.R, check the file functionsForSVI.R.
I adapted the function that calculates SVI from https://github.com/azh2/Social-Vulnerability-R
